## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/animi4695/devchallenges/master/screenshots/404.png)

This challenge is to test basic HTML and CSS skills from devchallenges.io. At first it felt easier than to code it. Later I studied an article on how to convert designs to webpages and felt little comfortable.

I have learned designing and developing the raw layout and applying styles to make the webpages responsive
